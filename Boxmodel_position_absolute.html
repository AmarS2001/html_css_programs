<!--When the position is set to absolute, an element can move according to the first positioned ancestor.
“Positioned?? What is a positioned element?”
A positioned element is one whose position value is either relative, absolute or fixed. So unless the position is not set or static, an element is positioned.
The characteristic of a positioned element is that it can act as a reference point for its child elements.-->
